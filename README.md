# Evaluating the Use of GNNs and Transfer Learning for Oral Bioavailability Prediction


>ðŸ“‹  Optional: include a graphic explaining your approach/main result, bibtex entry, link to demos, blog posts and tutorials

This repository is the offical implementation of my Honours Thesis

This repository consists of 2 folders and 4 python scripts:

1. data 
    1. graph_data: csv files of solubility dataset and oral bioavailability dataset
    2. oral_avail_fingerprints: csv files of oral bioavailability dataset fingerprints
    3. oral_mol_desc: csv files of oral bioavailability dataset molecular descriptors 

2. notebooks --> mainly 3 parts to it as listed below.
    1. Random forest model
    2. GNN from scratch models 
    3. Transfer learning models 
    
3. config.py
    1. hyperparameters and constant variables used in this project

4. engine.py, model.py, utils.py
    1. Contains GNN models and helper functions used in this project 
    
To replicate, please install the dependencies below and follow the instructions in the notebooks.
Please download the saved models from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19O4Xo_F-6MKK5H6JE0ykrQ4ZNXoYdOCJ?usp=share_link).
